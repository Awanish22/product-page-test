# Frontend Task

## Description:
Your task is to build out a product page using the designs from [here](./designs/desktop-design.jpg). A [style guide](./style-guide.md) is also provided to reference the different colours available.

## Developer Notes
- Configure the application by running `composer install && npm install`
- To run the application you need a minimum of php7.3 to serve the application. Once php is installed you may run `php artisan serve`
- Open a second terminal and run `npm run watch`
- By default you should be able to go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser and the application will be ready to use.

## Requirements:
- Use the design to create a pixel perfect UI using VueJS
- A vue router has been setup for you already with a `slug` route param. Use this as part of your development

### Bonus:
- Implement a cart model so that user's cart is persistent
- Write feature tests to ensure the functionality of your API endpoints. Use PHPUnit for writing tests.
